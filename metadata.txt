about=The CHM from LIDAR plugin creates a Canopy Height Model (CHM) starting from LIDAR data (DTM and DSM First Pulse). In particular, it uses the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and the Digital Surface Model (DSM) processed also from different surveys to compute the CHM. The CHM computation can be done using all the input data provided by the user or for a specific area of interest defined by the user. The final output can be saved defining the desired file format, coordinate reference system and resolution in a folder specified by the user. The file tile_dsm_dtm.gpkg contains by default data of Regione Veneto (Italy) which has founded this work. Each user can modify the data included in this file with data of their LIDAR survey campaigns.
